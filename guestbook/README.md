# Guestbook

## Description

The Guestbook demo application is a complete dapp showcasing multiple Stellar features, including smart contracts, smart wallet, frontend bindings and passkey implementation. The guestbook shows all messages written by users, and allows users to sign up with passkeys and write (and edit) messages.

The presentation walks through some of the fundamental features of the guestbook like the smart contract, bindings, passkey kit and frontend. The purpose of the presentation is to give a high level overview of how the basic features of the dapp are built and work. For a more in-depth explanation, the documentation is recommended.

## Target Audience

**Intermediate** or **Experienced**

The target audience is developers that have some knowledge of smart contracts and web applications in general, and are interested in dapp development.

The presentation requires some knowledge of how Stellar smart contracts work, since there’s no introduction to smart contracts on Stellar. It assumes that the audience at least has tried to deploy and invoke a Stellar smart contract.

The same can be said about the frontend part of the presentation, it requires some frontend experience. Knowledge of Svelte is not required, but might be helpful.

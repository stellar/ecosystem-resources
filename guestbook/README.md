# Guestbook

## Description

This application is a decentralized application (dapp) that interacts with a smart contract guestbook, allowing users to read and write public messages. A passkey-enabled smart wallet is managing user authentication, and implements basic wallet features for allowing the user to send a donation to the guestbook maintainer.

## Target Audience

This guestbook has many moving parts, so is best-suited for intermediate or experienced developers.

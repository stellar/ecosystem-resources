# KALE

## Description

KALE, a Stellar asset, can be acquired via a mining contract. One KALE can be farmed per minute, with rewards split among farmers based on their contributions. This activation highlights the ease of getting users on-chain, and interacting with smart wallets in a matter of seconds compared to traditional crypto on-boarding processes. Instructors can use this activation to demonstrate smart wallet user interactions, and highlight the importance of storage choices in smart contract design.

## Target Audience

KALE can be used to demonstrate on-boarding to potential network users, and can also instruct developers concerning smart contract design choices.

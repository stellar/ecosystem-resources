## Description

KALE, a Stellar asset, can be acquired via a mining contract. One KALE can be farmed per minute, with rewards split among farmers based on their contributions. This activation highlights the ease of getting users on-chain, and interacting with smart wallets in a matter of seconds compared to traditional crypto on-boarding processes. Instructors can use this activation to demonstrate smart wallet user interactions, and highlight the importance of storage choices in smart contract design.

## Target Audience

KALE can be used to demonstrate on-boarding to potential network users, and can also instruct developers concerning smart contract design choices.

### User-Facing Audience

KALE can be useful as an experience for users of smart wallets and passkeys. Highlights the ease of getting on-boarded.

### Developer-Facing Audience

KALE can also be used as a more technical walkthrough of operating with issued assets in a smart contract.

For more advanced audiences, it might be a good exercise to say "ok, every time a block completes, we want to both `plant` and then `harvest`. Now, you write and deploy a contract that invokes both of those functions in one single call, rather than two separate transactions."

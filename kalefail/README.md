# KaleFail

## Description

KailFail is an attempt to riff on the popular KALEpail project in fun new ways. The goal is to experiment with some new and exciting ways of utilizing KALE. This activation will walk developers through creating a smart contract that acts as the administrator of a Stellar Asset, and incorporating those contract interactions into a dapp.

## Target Audience

KaleFail is designed to teach developers about interacting with Stellar assets through smart contract functions and dapp development.

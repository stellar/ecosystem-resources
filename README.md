Resources, content, tutorials, and developer activations available to the community for in-person events and hackathons.

If you are interested in running a training, workshop, etc. for a collection of developers and/or users, you don't have to reinvent the wheel! This repository will serve as an "a la carte" menu you can make selection(s) from, as you please. You'll be able to choose from several activations, accompanied by a list of resources, links, suggested audiences, potential topics, and more.

## KALE

KALE, a Stellar asset, can be acquired via a mining contract. One KALE can be farmed per minute, with rewards split among farmers based on their contributions. This activation highlights the ease of getting users on-chain, and interacting with smart wallets in a matter of seconds compared to traditional crypto on-boarding processes. Instructors can use this activation to demonstrate smart wallet user interactions, and highlight the importance of storage choices in smart contract design.

**Target Audience**: KALE can be used to demonstrate on-boarding to potential network users, and can also instruct developers concerning smart contract design choices.

## KaleFail

KailFail is an attempt to riff on the popular KALEpail project in fun new ways. The goal is to experiment with some new and exciting ways of utilizing KALE. This activation will walk developers through creating a smart contract that acts as the administrator of a Stellar Asset, and incorporating those contract interactions into a dapp.

**Target Audience**: KaleFail is designed to teach developers about interacting with Stellar assets through smart contract functions and dapp development.

## Guestbook

This application is a decentralized application (dapp) that interacts with a smart contract guestbook, allowing users to read and write public messages. A passkey-enabled smart wallet is managing user authentication, and implements basic wallet features for allowing the user to send a donation to the guestbook maintainer.

**Target Audience**: This guestbook has many moving parts, so is best-suited for intermediate or experienced developers.
